# SCRABBLE3
## play scrabble remotely

## Build fat jar
Run a maven build package to get your executable fat jar.


## Launch Game
To launch the Game simply run the jar. Make sure you have jdk-11 installed. Normally the app should launch when double clicking the jar. If not try using the command line “cd” to the directory where the jar lies and type “java -jar SCRABBLE3.jar”. In case this doesn’t launch the app, please check your java installation.
The app will create a .scrabble folder in your home directory, storing your userprofile, the dictionary and settings. Make sure there is no such folder before the first game launch. If you no longer want to play the game you can delete the folder, however this deletes your all of your settings and statistics.
If you log in to the same local network e.g. via the Uni Mannheim VPN, you can join your friends and play together. Have fun!

## Settings
If you play against "hard" or "unbeatable" AI, please allow at least 2 min (120 sec) as time per player, to ensure maximum usability.
